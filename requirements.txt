# Backend deps – install only what you need:
#
# DA3:        git clone https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Depth-Anything-3 && pip install -e .
# UniDepth:   git clone https://github.com/lpiccinelli-eth/UniDepth && pip install -e .
# MapAnything: git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/map-anything && pip install -e .
#
# All backends need torch>=2.0, but each model repo pins its own version.
# Don't install torch here – let the model repo handle it to avoid conflicts.
